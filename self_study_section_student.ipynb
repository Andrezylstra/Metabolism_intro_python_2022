Substrate inhibition. (2 points)\n","\n","---\n","\n","Substrate inhibition is a type of response observed for kinetics of some enzymes. If often has important biological functions. For example, dopamine produced in our bodies comes from tyrosine in our food. Despite the fact that amount of tyrosine in our food significantly varies, production of dopamine in our bodies is rather constant. This behaviour is caused by substrate inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase (enzyme that converts tyrosine to dopamine) by tyrosine. (Reed et al.
