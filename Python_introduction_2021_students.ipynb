Python is a very powerful language, and it will be a helpful tool in your further studies, as it is an alternative to Microsoft Excel. Thus, another aim is:\n","\n","**Aim 3: To introduce you to a few basics of Python programming techniques. Specifically, we will introduce you to a number of basic elements of Python (*i.e.* variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, plotting)**\n","\n","Today, we will start with Aim 3."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9B84UyjRb4kA"},"source":["## Jupyter notebook \n","\n","- What you are currently running in your browser is called a **Jupyter notebook**. \n","- A Jupyter notebook provides an environment for you to write structured text (similar to Microsoft Word) and at the same time run your code, and save your analysis results. \n","- All content in a Jupyter notebook is divided into containers that are called **cells**. \n","- In order to render the text inside a cell, or run the code, you need to press **Shift + Enter** or push the play button located at the left top corner of the cell. \n","- **New cells can be added** using the '+ Code' or '+ Text' buttons under the toolbar at the top of the screen."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jpcxrZ2yb4kD"},"source":["## Approach\n","In this practical, each part will be introduced by the teaching assistants. During each introduction, we will go through the Python syntax you will need for the exercises of that part. After the introduction you can do the exercises, which we will check together before moving to the next part. The answers to the exercises, together with an explanation of the Python syntax, will also be made available on the Student Portal (once all groups have done this practical).\n","\n","## Automatic feedback\n","All exercises have automatic feedback options to help you solve the exercise correctly. Specifically, there are two options: hint and check.  The hint options provides you with a hint to solve the exercises correctly. The check options checks whether your solution is correct. Please note that this check can be very strict. For instance, whether or not you capitalize a character can be the difference between a correct and incorrect solution. \n","\n","The automated feedback is, of course, not the only feedback you can get during the practical. Please donâ€™t hesitate to ask your fellow students and teaching assistants for help if you need it.

If you already have some programming experience and are able to quickly finish the exercises we work on during the practical, you can already start on these self-study exercises.\n","\n","The self-study exercises are on all the subjects we treat during the practical in this notebook.
