The answers to the exercises, together with an explanation of the Python syntax, will also be made available on the Student Portal (once all groups have done this practical).\n","\n","## Automatic feedback\n","All exercises have automatic feedback options to help you solve the exercise correctly. Specifically, there are two options: hint and check.  The hint options provides you with a hint to solve the exercises correctly. The check options checks whether your solution is correct. Please note that this check can be very strict. For instance, whether or not you capitalize a character can be the difference between a correct and incorrect solution. \n","\n","The automated feedback is, of course, not the only feedback you can get during the practical.
